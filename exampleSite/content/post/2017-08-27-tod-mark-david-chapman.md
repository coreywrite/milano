We _pierced_ the side of the idol  
With the sharpened neck of an electric guitar  
Bottled the water from the wound  

```
Holy relic- the essence of star
```

> But what does she care, it's just another blank stare to a world that loves and hates you on a dare

Where the orphans ask the widows 

> the meaning of 'fair'

So let this be a drink to quench this **uncontrollable thirst**  

Tie the belt a notch tighter around anxious hearts set to _burst_  
And when this once at least gilded cage has been  
Stripped bare of flesh cold and numb

> What have you done **Mark David Chapman?**  

Let all the desperate hours of boredom
Lead you to some ```meaning of truth```

Bumps and bruises and notebooks for heaven's _jury as proof_  
The emotions were:

* shrink wrapped
* sold as scraps

> Choose any scene from the vending machine  

Somewhere lost in the night, a satellite transmitted dream  
Industrial revolutions of the soul interchangeable hearts it's manufacturing  
If we wear out each other it's o.k., just go buy another  
So let this be a drink to calm the shaking hands that you've found  
Let this be release, *forever unwound*
